# Self Intro:
Hi, I am Steven, senior studying Geography: Data Science at University of Washington. I am interested in GIS and data science because they will help people's life in many ways. In my spare time, I enjoy watching anime and play video games with my friends. My favourite anime would be [ <em> Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion). It is nice to meet you and hope we could learn a lot of new stuff in the coming weeks.
